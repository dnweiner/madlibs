For the creative portion, we added several features which required more work to implement than their brief descriptions suggest:

-users can upload stories to the database
-users can download completed stories as newly-generated txt files
-back to home button
-users can populate a story with randomly-generated words and numbers
-added words are underlined

TA Login instructions:
No login required!

NOTE: does not play nicely with files with blank lines in them: otherwise, works

textfiles.com/stories has an assortment of txt files for your perusal and uploading needs. We found this by Googling "txt file stories"
