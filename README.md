# madlibs
This project is arguably my most ambitious, as it required the self-teaching of an entirely new web technology: Django. The user is able to play games of madlibs using text files of their choosing, and the natural language toolkit (NLTK) module of Python is used to remove keywords and inform the user of the necessary replacement categories. Stories may also be filled in using randomly generated words.
